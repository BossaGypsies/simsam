             <p>SIMS (School Information Management System) is a world-class management information system used by over 22,000 schools in England, Wales and Northern Ireland.
             It's a great product, but like all good things, there's room for improvement, that's where the SIMS Automation Module (SIMSAM) comes in.
             </p>
             <p>Our solution has been developed specifically for the education sector and has been refined to meet the changing needs of schools over the last 24 years. Ofsted requirements have placed an admistrative overhead on teaching which can be a distraction from the core skill and strength of Teachers. That is where SIMSAM can step in to automate the processes required as a result of an OFSTED inspection.</p>
             <p>Our system has a extends the unique depth and breadth of SIMS, enabling schools to easily deliver core requirements based on data that is already in the system, and interpreting it to help Teachers deliver robust seating plans.</p>
